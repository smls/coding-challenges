# Coding Challenge Submissions

In this repository I keep code submissions that I've written for various "coding challenge" sites.


| Folder            | Challenge Site | Description |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| [`codegolf`](codegolf)               | [codegolf.stackexchange.com](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com)          | These are all about solving problems using the **shortest** possible source code (measured in bytes), regardless of how ugly and slow it becomes... :) |
| [`dailyprogrammer`](dailyprogrammer) | [reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) | These tend to be about writing **elegant** and/or **performant** code.  |
| [`rosettacode`](rosettacode)         | [rosettacode.org](https://rosettacode.org)                                | These tend to be about writing **elegant** code - performance is secondary.  |
